## Required Tools

To run locally you need:
* cargo, which can be installed via rustup
* mdbook, which can be installed by `cargo install mdbook@^0.4.37` or <https://github.com/rust-lang/mdBook/releases>, with a version compatible with 0.4.37.
* mdbook-fiction-tools, which can be install by `cargo install --git https://github.com/chorman0773/mdbook-fiction-tools>`. 

Once tools are installed, you can run `mdbook build` or `mdbook serve` as usual for an mdbook and view it
